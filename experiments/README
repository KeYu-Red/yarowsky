This directory contains the scripts for running our experiments. See the "runall" script for how to run the experiments, and either use the script directly or use it as a list of steps to follow.

The included data is a sample of the named entity classification task of Collins & Singer 1999 and three of the word sense disambiguation tasks of Eisner and Karakos 2005. The original data was provided by the respective authors, and has been reformatted here. The named entity test set has been filtered to remove month and weekday examples as described in Collins & Singer 1999. Here the train and test sets include only the first few examples for each task, which is sufficient to run the experiment scripts but not to replicate the complete experiments. Contact us or the authors of the respective papers for the full data.

Some of the experiment scripts may require modification to work in paths containing filenames with spaces.
